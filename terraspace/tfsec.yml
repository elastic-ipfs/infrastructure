# Exclude Reasons:
# Encryption at rest with CMK: We won't enable that at this moment. Details: https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02BZPRS9HP/p1662043881772469
# Image immutability: There isn't a way of finding out the newest image tag from aws_ecr_repository neither to create an exception for "latest" tag (https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/878)
