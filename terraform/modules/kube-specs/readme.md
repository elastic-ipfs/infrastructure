# Readme

This whole module must be reviewed. Specs should be applied when some service has changes: Their own individual workflows.

These are the only things it should be doing:
- Install metric services
- Manage OIDC, roles and permissions
- (If ever applicable to this project) Install/Configure Ingress and CertManager
